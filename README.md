## Classic Frogger Game

###Description
This is a frogger inspired arcade game. You are a horn girl who wants to cross the road to reach the river but
there are some disrespectful lady bugs who want to stop you (no one knows why).

###Instructions
To play the game download all the files and open index.html in your browser.

###How to play
Use the arrow keys to move the character.
Avoid hitting the lady bugs while trying to make it to the river on the other side of the stone road. When you reach the water your character will reset back to the grass so that you can try again.

###Aditional notes
There will be updates coming soon with collectibles, new obstacles, new enemies, and a soundtrack inspired by 90s video game soundtracks.
